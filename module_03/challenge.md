# Challenge

- Build a nice box (`div`) with some content, padding, a border (style it as you want) and some margin.
- Set different padding and margin for the four different sides of the box.
- Add the same box below the first box and note if you can identify any strange behaviour.
- Give the first box a height of 100% of the window height.
- Set the first box back to a more reasonable height of 300px and set its width to 50%.
- Position the two boxes next to each other.
- Hide box number 1 and see how that changes the page.
