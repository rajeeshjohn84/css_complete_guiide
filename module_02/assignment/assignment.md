# Instructions

- Style the above `<h1>` to use any color of your choice ans a _sans_serif_ font.
- Style all `<code>` to use the _monospace_ font-family and have _red_ text.
- Use a _class selector_ to ensure that the `<code>` elements in the second `<li>` element have a different color (e: _green_)
- Switch the order of the rules and use the _dev tools_ of your browser to understand how _specificity_ resolves conflicts (for the `<code>` elements).
- Set a _default_ font (eg: _sans-serif_) for the entire content of your page and use _inheritance_ to change the font of the `<li>` items, too.
- Use a _combinator_ to give all `<li>` elements but the fir one (!) a _black_ **background** and _white_ **text color**
- Use another combinator to now give all `<li>` inside an `<ol>` element a _black_ **background** & _white_ **text color**.
